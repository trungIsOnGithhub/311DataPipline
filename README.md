### Build a 311* Data Pipeline with Visualization

> *311 mean next up after 911 in the US. It is like 911, but for non-emergencies. It is about reported issues within a city: potholes in the road, trees down, trash problems, homeless that might be in need of assistance... This project used a [SeeClickFix](https://crm.seeclickfix.com/) as data source, also a 311 data site.

> Build with Apache Nifi 1.27.x - Python 3.10.x - Elasticsearch - Kibana
